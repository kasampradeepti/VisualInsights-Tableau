# VisualInsights-Tableau
This repository contains data visualizations I created during my academics.

I developed a visualization tool using Tableau to represent global COVID-19 statistics. The tool showcases key metrics such as the average number of positive cases, new cases, daily deaths, and new deaths per country. It includes interactive features like:

Bar charts highlighting the total positive case counts for major countries.

Line charts tracking daily trends in positivity rates.

Geospatial maps visualizing case distributions globally.

Drill-down tables with detailed regional data for individual countries.

This visualization enhances data interpretation by providing both high-level summaries and detailed insights.
